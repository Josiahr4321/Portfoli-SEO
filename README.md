# Portfolio-SEO
This is my portfolio that I have made from scratch.

I created my own HTML and CSS to give my portfolio a simple design.

I will add more to it in the future as this is just a basic mock up.

You will see a page that has links connected to the text in the nav.

My images are also linked to the work that I have currently done.

I have put in background colors inside the nav,border, and page.

In the contact me section there is four ways to contact me if you ever need to.

There is alt tags for the images that allow people who are visually challenged to know what the image is.
